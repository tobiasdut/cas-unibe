# Module 6 — Deep Learning

Lectures and practice notebooks for the deep learning sessions.

## Structure
- `01 Lectures/` – PDF decks for each lecture (currently `Lecture1_GSC_2025.pdf` through `Lecture4_GSC_2025.pdf`).
- `02 Notebooks/` – supporting notebooks or workshop booklets, e.g., `Muerren_tutorials.pdf`.

Add future lecture decks and labs using the same numeric prefixing scheme so they stay in chronological order.
