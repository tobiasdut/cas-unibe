# CAS M4 Repository

This repository consolidates the material for the CAS Applied Data Science module series. Each module has its own folder (`module_1` … `module_6`) with lecture notes, exercises, datasets, or slide decks, plus a README that documents the local structure so you can quickly locate resources.

## Repository layout
- `module_1` – Data acquisition and management notebooks, datasets, SQL demos, and project scaffolding.
- `module_2` – Statistical inference project examples and regression solution sets.
- `module_3` – Machine learning lecture notebook(s) and slots for supplementary readings.
- `module_4` – Ethics, security, Git/GitHub, and legal slide decks.
- `module_5` – Placeholder for consolidation workshops and cross-module recaps.
- `module_6` – Deep learning lecture decks and supporting notebooks/booklets.
- `final_project` – Final CAS Project.
