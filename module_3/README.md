# Module 3 — Data Analysis and Machine Learning

Notebooks and reference readings for the analysis and machine learning lectures.

## Structure
- `Lecture notes/` – working notebooks such as `Python_refresher.ipynb` that accompany the in-class sessions.
- `Further reading/` – placeholder directory for supplemental papers or articles to reinforce concepts introduced in lectures.

Add new readings to `Further reading/` or extend the lecture notebook set as the module evolves.
