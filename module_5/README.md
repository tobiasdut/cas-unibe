# Module 5 — Consolidations

This folder is reserved for the consolidation block where cross-module projects and recaps live.

## Structure
- *(empty for now)* – add workshop notebooks, recap decks, or integration projects here as soon as they become available.

Follow the naming and README pattern used in the other modules when new material is added so the repository stays consistent.
