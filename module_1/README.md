# Module 1 — Data Acquisition and Management

This module aggregates the notebooks, datasets, and project materials covering web scraping, APIs, SQL, and data cleaning workflows presented in class.

## Structure
- `Lectures/`: Instructor notebooks for the main sessions (web scraping, APIs, advanced scraping).
- `Lectures with solutions/`: Annotated notebooks mirroring the lectures with solved code cells.
- `Lectures (1).gitkeep`: Placeholder so the empty lectures folder stays tracked when content is trimmed.
- `Exercises/`: Hands-on notebooks for scraping, API usage, and Selenium automation, each paired with a solutions notebook.
- `Day 3 afternoon/`: SQL relational modeling slides, references, scripts, and the sample `university.db` SQLite database.
- `Project Submission/`: Drop zone for the module project hand-in (currently a placeholder directory).
- `danger.csv`, `garbage.csv`, `iris.csv`, `merged.csv`, `sleep.csv`, `StatWiSo2023_raw.csv`, `StatWiSo2024_raw.csv`: Source datasets used throughout the notebooks.
- `CDR-Example*.pdf`: Reference case studies for call-data-record analysis.
